Customer Churn Data Analysis

📊My Customer Churn Analysis Project in Power BI! 📈

🔍 I worked on a cool project during my free time, exploring customer churn using Power BI. Let me share my journey as I'm on the path to becoming a Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst.

💼 The Road to BI Analyst💼

To be great at BI Analyst, you need a bunch of skills: digging data from databases, asking the right questions, Excel number-crunching, transforming data with Power Query, and presenting insights with visuals.

🔍 Project Highlights 📊

For this project, I delved into customer churn in a pretend telecom company. Here's what I did:

Database: Kaggle (Customer Churn)
Data Cleanup: With Power Query, I made the data neat and tidy.
Number Crunching: I used Excel to spot interesting things.
Cool Charts: I made nifty graphs and charts in Power BI.
